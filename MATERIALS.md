# Useful links and materials

## Scrum

The development of this code base follows an incremental approach and, for this reason, agile methodologies well fit for it.
Master thesis projects are developed using [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html), but in-course projects might also benefit from using this paradigm.

## Git

This is a version-controlled git-based repo.
If you don't know what version control and git are, or just need to refresh them, you can look at [this handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

## Object-oriented programming and design patterns

Most of the code in this repo is object-oriented and written in C++.
Quality software often benefits from design patterns, that are constructs useful to solve common software design problems.
This repo sometimes implements some of them, like singletons and factories, to mention some.
You can give a look at some examples [here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/cpp).

If you are not confident with C++, a lot of documentation is available online.
If you need more detailed documentation about the language, please ask your teacher/supervisor.

## ROS2 and MoveIt!2 tutorials

This code base is heavily based on the *Robot Operating System (ROS)* and its planning system *MoveIt!*.
Please make sure to follow the official tutorials and documentation before contributing to the development:

* [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)
* [MoveIt!2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html)
* [ros2_control](https://control.ros.org/master/index.html)
